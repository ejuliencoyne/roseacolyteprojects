    <h3>UPDATES</h3>
    <p><i>February 3, 2026</i></p>
    <p>Finally revamped my <a href="/needlepoint">needlepoint</a> page. It now has images of all my currently released designs as well as a bunch of charts, and more info generally! Just in time for new designs to launch in a few weeks, lol. But it feels nice for it to be up to date for now at least.</p>
    <p>I'm going to have to make an updates archive page soon! Glad that I have actually been using and updating this site.</p>

      <p><i>November 25, 2025</i></p>
      <p>I updated the layout of this website a bit, and added an "About" page with a bit more history about me!</p>
      <p>Also, I really should update my needlepoint page (both to look more professional and because I have a lot more designs now...) but in the interest of actually getting some updates out there, I am leaving it be for now.</p>

      <p><i>June 11, 2025</i></p>
      <p>Major exciting announcement: my needlepoint designs will soon be available as pre-painted canvases and charts from <a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com/shop-all/rose-acolyte">Saturnalia Stitching</a>! I am so excited about working with Abbey of Saturnalia, and the canvases look BEAUTIFUL. You can see more photos of them on her store website and also on the <a href="/needlepoint">needlepoint page</a> of this site, which is also new!</p>
      <p>In the future, I would love to write up a guide to how I think about needlepoint, stitching, and painting my own canvases at home, as I have a more "cowboy" approach to it than I have seen on most guides online. Let me know if you'd like to see something like this and I'll try to get my act together to put a needlepoint guide on this site.</p>
      <p>Other updates to the site include a <a href="/projects">projects page</a> with links out to pages for pottery and needlepoint, and in the future, quilts, rugs/punchneedle, other things... I'm excited to have somewhere to make more pages for other things I've done!</p>
      <p>One more thing for people local to Southern Maine; I have a small show of my quilts, rugs, and punchneedles up for June and some of July at one of my very favorite places, <a href="https://www.pastandfuturecraft.com">Past + Future Craft Exchange</a>, a secondhand fabric and crafts store in Westbrook, ME. There are also some photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roseacolyte/">Instagram</a>, for people who aren't local!</p>

      <p>Welcome to the new website! <i>Rose Acolyte Ceramics</i> has now become just <i>Rose Acolyte</i>, since I have been doing a lot of textile work lately (specifically needlepoint design) that I wanted an online home for.</p>
      <p>In the future I hope to have a list here of a bunch of other creative projects I've done, all collected in one place. As I make new pages for these or get up to new stuff, I'll post updates here. Thanks for following along!</p>
