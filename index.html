    <h3>UPDATES</h3>
      <p><i>6/11/2025</i></p>
      <p>Major exciting announcement: my needlepoint designs will soon be available as pre-painted canvases and charts from <a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com/shop-all/rose-acolyte">Saturnalia Stitching</a>! I am so excited about working with Abbey of Saturnalia, and the canvases look BEAUTIFUL. You can see more photos of them on her store website and also on the <a href="/needlepoint">needlepoint page</a> of this site, which is also new!</p>
      <p>In the future, I would love to write up a guide to how I think about needlepoint, stitching, and painting my own canvases at home, as I have a more "cowboy" approach to it than I have seen on most guides online. Let me know if you'd like to see something like this and I'll try to get my act together to put a needlepoint guide on this site.</p>
      <p>Other updates to the site include a <a href="/projects">projects page</a> with links out to pages for pottery and needlepoint, and in the future, quilts, rugs/punchneedle, other things... I'm excited to have somewhere to make more pages for other things I've done!</p>
      <p>One more thing for people local to Southern Maine; I have a small show of my quilts, rugs, and punchneedles up for June and some of July at one of my very favorite places, <a href="https://www.pastandfuturecraft.com">Past + Future Craft Exchange</a>, a secondhand fabric and crafts store in Westbrook, ME. There are also some photos on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roseacolyte/">Instagram</a>, for people who aren't local!</p>

      <p><i>5/6/2025</i></p>
      <p>Welcome to the new website! <i>Rose Acolyte Ceramics</i> has now become just <i>Rose Acolyte</i>, since I have been doing a lot of textile work lately (specifically needlepoint design) that I wanted an online home for.</p>
      <p>In the future I hope to have a list here of a bunch of other creative projects I've done, all collected in one place. As I make new pages for these or get up to new stuff, I'll post updates here. Thanks for following along!</p>

    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p>Rose Acolyte is <a href="https://ejuliencoyne.com">Julien Coyne</a>'s creative project space, established in 2023 and based out of southern Maine.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Q</strong>: How can I buy things from you?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: Needlepoint charts and canvases are available online from <a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com/shop-all/rose-acolyte">Saturnalia Stitching</a>.</p>
    <p>For everything else I make, if you're in the Portland, Maine area you can usually find my pottery for sale at Coveside Coffee. I also make very occasional appearances at local craft markets. If you are elsewhere in the country/world, your best bet is to get in touch with me directly - I am perennially planning to open an online shop, but I haven't managed to do so yet!</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Q</strong>: Where else can I find you online?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: I am on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roseacolyte/">@roseacolyte</a>, and I also have a newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/whyamimakingthis">Why Am I Making This</a>. (It has been on hiatus for some time, but I am planning to start it up again soon.)</p>
