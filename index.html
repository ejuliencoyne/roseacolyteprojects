    <h3>UPDATES</h3>
    <p><i>February 3, 2026</i></p>
    <p>Finally revamped my <a href="/needlepoint">needlepoint</a> page. It now has images of all my currently released designs as well as a bunch of <a href="/needlepoint#charts">charts</a>, and more info generally! Just in time for new designs to launch in a few weeks, lol. But it feels nice for it to be up to date for now at least.</p>
    <p>I also have a new <a href="/quilts">quilts</a> page with some of my quilting work from last year. It is disorganized and I wish I had a better story to tell about all of it... but I'm just putting it up now so as not to let the perfect become the enemy of the acceptable.</p>
    <p>There is also now an updates archive page (see the link below) so that the homepage is less cluttered with updates from last year. I'm glad that I have actually been using and updating this site!</p>
