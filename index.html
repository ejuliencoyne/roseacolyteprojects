    <h3>UPDATES</h3>
      <p><i>5/6/2025</i></p>
      <p>Welcome to the new website! <i>Rose Acolyte Ceramics</i> has now become just <i>Rose Acolyte</i>, since I have been doing a lot of textile work lately (specifically needlepoint design) that I wanted an online home for.</p>
      <p>In the future I hope to have a list here of a bunch of other creative projects I've done, all collected in one place. As I make new pages for these or get up to new stuff, I'll post updates here. Thanks for following along!</p>

    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p>Rose Acolyte is <a href="https://ejuliencoyne.com">Julien Coyne</a>'s creative project space, established in 2023 and based out of southern Maine.</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Q</strong>: How can I buy things from you?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: Needlepoint charts and canvases will be available online very soon! Watch this space.</p>
    <p>For everything else I make, if you're in the Portland, Maine area you can usually find my pottery for sale at Coveside Coffee. I also make very occasional appearances at local craft markets. If you are elsewhere in the country/world, your best bet is to get in touch with me directly - I am perennially planning to open an online shop, but I haven't managed to do so yet!</p>
    <br>

    <p><strong>Q</strong>: Where else can I find you online?</p>
    <p><strong>A</strong>: I am on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roseacolyte/">@roseacolyte</a>, and I also have a newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/whyamimakingthis">Why Am I Making This</a>. (It has been on hiatus for some time, but I am planning to start it up again soon.)</p>
