    <h3>QUILTS</h3>
    <p>I started making quilts in late 2024. I had recently moved, and had been going through a lot of my clothing to get rid of things I no longer needed. Instead of donating or throwing away the clothes, I had this idea to repurpose the fabric from them into a quilt.</p>

    <p>I had so much fun making this one (and I still had so much fabric left from my clothes) that I decided to make more.</p>

    <p>Interestingly, I actually didn't have a full picture in my mind of what "quilting" was before I deccided to make my first quilt. I thought of quilting mainly as the process of putting together a patchwork design (the "quilt top"). Theoretically I guess I knew that </p>

    <p>I'm not a huge fan of long sewing sessions on a sewing machine, so all of my big quilts so far have been hand quilted.</p>

    <p>I have also done some experimenting with making quilted bags. This is the only place so far I have done machine quilting (because quilting a small bag panel on a machine is much more doable to me than other quilts).</p>

    <p>More quilts here soon, I'm sure!</p>
