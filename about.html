        <h4>ABOUT ROSE ACOLYTE</h4>
        <p>Rose Acolyte is <a href="https://ejuliencoyne.com">E. Julien Coyne</a>'s creative project space, established in 2023 and based out of southern Maine.</p>
        <p>I have been drawing, painting, and doing all manner of creative things for my whole life, but have always had a hard time pinning down what it is that I do when I say that I am an artist. Rose Acolyte is my attempt to have an umbrella to put everything under, whether that is needlepoint, printmaking, quilting, painting, sewing, pottery, rug-making, or whatever other creative thing I have been seriously interested in for some particular period in time.</p>
        <p>It's on me that I chose a confusing brand name, so if you forget my person-name and call me Rose I won't be mad at you.</p>

        <h3>Q & A</h3>

        <p><strong>Q</strong>: How can I buy things from you?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: Needlepoint charts and canvases are available online from <a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com/shop-all/rose-acolyte">Saturnalia Stitching</a>.</p>
        <p>For everything else I make, if you're in the Portland, Maine area you can usually find my pottery for sale at Coveside Coffee. I also make very occasional appearances at local craft markets. If you are elsewhere in the country/world, your best bet is to get in touch with me directly - I am perennially planning to open an online shop, but I haven't managed to do so yet!</p>
        <br>

        <p><strong>Q</strong>: Where else can I find you online?</p>
        <p><strong>A</strong>: I am on Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/roseacolyte/">@roseacolyte</a>, and I also have a newsletter called <a href="https://buttondown.com/whyamimakingthis">Why Am I Making This</a>. (It has been on hiatus for some time, but I am planning to start it up again soon.)</p>

    <h3>HISTORY</h3>

    <p class="headline">A list of my ever-changing arts and crafts focuses for the more art-ful years of my life.</p>

    <p><strong>2015</strong>: I graduate from university (major: physics and philosophy) and decide that after spending my school years with art as "just a hobby", I would like to "take art more seriously" (while still being employed at a non-art day job)</p>

    <p><strong>2016</strong>: Illustration and comics. I take classes from <a href="https://jerel-dye.squarespace.com">Jerel Dye</a> while living in Boston. I start keeping a sketchbook, which I continue doing until present day - I have 8 or 9 of then now!</p>

    <p><strong>2017</strong>: Printmaking, photography, and digital art. I am a member of <a href="https://www.megalo.org">Megalo Print Studio</a> in Canberra, Australia, where I spend a lot of time, working on my own as well as taking classes with <a href="https://johnhartartist.com/about">John Hart</a> and <a href="https://julian-laffan.squarespace.com/selectedworks">Julian Laffan</a> (Being a member of Megalo was what made me start seeing myself as a "real artist", so it still holds a special place in my heart). I also start exploring film photography at <a href="https://photoaccess.org.au">Manuka PhotoAccess</a>. I finally learn to draw in Photoshop.</p>

    <p><strong>2018</strong>: Painting. I take classes with <a href="https://www.valeriewallacefinearts.com">Valerie Wallace</a> in Orono, Maine.</p>

    <p><strong>2019</strong>: Painting and some textiles. I take classes with <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mary.brooking.art">Mary Brooking</a> and <a href="https://www.missydunaway.com">Missy Dunaway</a> in southern Maine. Late in the year, I take a class about punchneedle from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sjanecraft">S. Jane Craft</a>, and become quite obsessed quite quickly.</p>

    <p><strong>2020</strong>: Textiles, printmaking, and painting. I try to start printmaking again as a member of <a href="https://www.pickwickindependentpress.com">Pickwick Independent Press</a>, but am scuppered by the pandemic. I continue with punchneedle and try larger rug-making (see tiger rug above). I follow <a href="https://www.catherinegraffam.com">Cat Graffam</a>'s online art lessons to learn to paint portraits. I take up digital art again, drawing in Procreate.</p>

    <p><strong>2021</strong>: Drawing, pottery and photography. I take an incredibly influential online class in caricature drawing from <a href="https://www.stevebrodner.com">Steve Brodner</a>, which really changes how I think about drawing. I start photographing weddings with <a href="https://rubyjeanphotography.com">Ruby Jean Photography</a> and <a href="https://hagerweddings.com">Andrew Hager</a>, and start to do film photography more seriously again. I join <a href="https://portlandpottery.com">Portland Pottery</a> as a member (in <a href="https://www.barrelmakerpottery.com">Chris Cooper</a>'s class) after making tiny pottery at home for half the year and bringing it to Portland Pottery to be fired.</p>

    <p><strong>2022</strong>: Pottery, animation, and photography. I dabble a lot with different pottery styles. I play around with digital animation for <a href="https://lynxtuft.itch.io">tiny video games</a>. I do a lot of film photography.</p>

    <p><strong>2023</strong>: Pottery and needlepoint. I continue finding my pottery voice (highly influenced by the drawing I have been doing for all these years!) and decide on the name Rose Acolyte Ceramics for my pottery brand. I also discover needlepoint, which I do entirely on my own, drawing my own little homemade canvases and stitching them with DMC cotton.</p>

    <p><strong>2024</strong>: Pottery, painting, video games, and needlepoint. I try (and fail) to become much more serious about pottery. I try (and fail) to become more serious about painting again. I do more <a href="https://lynxtuft.itch.io/berry-quest">tiny video game</a> coding and animation. I continue doing homemade needlepoint in my own bubble.</p>
    
    <p><strong>2025</strong>: Needlepoint, quilting, and pottery. I learn to quilt at the beginning of the year and do my best to regularly attend <a href="https://www.instagram.com/t_bag_maine">Travis Clough</a>'s quilt club. I do an online workshop with <a href="https://tarafaughnan.com">Tara Faughan</a>. I continue with my little illustrated pottery in a casual way (I have maintained my Portland Pottery studio membership all these years). I finally leave my needlepoint bubble and join <a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com">Saturnalia Stitching</a> as an official designer.</p>
