    <h3>NEEDLEPOINT</h3>

    <p>I have been a needlepoint designer with <a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com/shop-all/designers/rose-acolyte">Saturnalia Stitching</a> since 2025, and a DIY needlepointer for a few years before that. Here are a few of my favorite Saturnalia designs:</p>

    <br>
    <h3>CHARTS, ETC</h3>

    <p>I hugely encourage anyone who is curious about needlepoint to try out making their own canvases with digital charts! There are many sources of charts - both for free and for purchase - online. I have a few designs that are are available as official charts:</p>

    <div class="project-item">
      <img class="inline" src="images/flower-tiger-preview.jpg" />
      <div class="project-item-text">
        <h4><a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com/shop-all/p/tigersintheflowerschart">Tiger in the Flowers</a></h4>
        <p>Available for $5 from Saturnalia. 5x7 inches on 13 mesh. This one is arevamp of a design originally from 2023, one of my first ever projects and still one of my favorite designs.</p>

        <p>Available for $10 from Saturnalia. 8x8 inches on 13 mesh. A nice medium-sized project with relaxing big areas to fill in. Easy and forgiving to freehand if you don't feel like counting the stitches!</p>

    <p>If there is a design or illustration of mine that isn't here which you'd like to paint/adapt into a needlepoint canvas yourself (for personal use only) instead of buying a pre-painted canvas, for <strong>most</strong> of my work I am happy to sell a virtual "ticket" for you to do this even if a chart is not officially available. You can send me a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/roseacolyte">tip on ko-fi</a> for $5-10 per design if you want to do this.</p>

    <p>There are a huge number of resources for getting started with DIY needlepoint, but I thought I would list a few places I like to get charts.</p>
    <li>You will find this on pretty much every list, so I'll start with the huge repository (hundreds!) of <a href="https://www.dmc.com/US/en/patterns/free-patterns-by-craft/cross-stitch">Free DMC charts</a>. Most of the rest of the links here have a mix of purchaseable and free charts.</li>
    <li>There are a <a href="https://www.saturnaliastitching.com/shop-all?category=Type,Charts">bunch of charts available from Saturnalia</a>, not just mine</li>
    <li>My Saturnalia sibling Meg of Needlepoint After Dark has charts of many of her designs available on her <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/NeedlepointAfterDark">Etsy store</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://fireandirisdesigns.com/collections/charts">Fire and Iris</a> has most of her Christmas designs available as charts</li>
    <li><a href="https://fridaynightneedlepoint.com/collections/digital-charts">Friday Night Needlepoint</a> has fun board-game related charts</li>
    <li>There are a ton of amazing cross stitch designers who have charts available online. A few of my favorites are <a href="https://www.blueflowerstitching.com/collections/all">Blue Flower Stitching</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/BoomerangStitches">Boomerang Stitches</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/SproutingLupine">Sprouting Lupine</a>, <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/DoizeDemos">Doize Demos</a>, <a href="https://ko-fi.com/themarigoldneedle/shop">The Marigold Needle</a>, and <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/badstitched">Bad Stitch</a>.</li>

    <h3>MY NEEDLEPOINT HISTORY</h3>

    <p>I started needlepoint in the summer of 2023 after spending time with my cousin Meghan, who works at a needlepoint store in Florida. I had never seen needlepoint before, but she did some stitching while visiting (of course), and it looked very fun and relaxing. She encouraged me to use some of my drawings as needlepoint designs.</p>

    <img src="images/needlepoint-cheetah.jpg">

    <img src="images/tiny-tiger-2.jpg">
    <p class="image-text">My first ever needlepoint item.</p>

    <p>I didn't map out my designs all that much before stitching them; I would sketch roughly on canvas with paint markers, and then figure out the exact stitching as I went.</p>

    <img src="images/needlepoint-tapestry.jpg">

    <p>I connected with Abbey of Saturnalia a little while after I started needlepointing, and through dedication on her part, I finally got my act together to publish some designs with her in spring/summer 2025. (Thank you for hunting me down, Abbey! Eternally grateful!) I have been an enthusiastic member of the Saturnalia design collective ("solar system") ever since.</p>

    <p>Even though I have fun stitching my professional designs now that they exist, I do my best to stay true to my DIY roots and also work on free-form projects that are roughly sketched on canvas.</p>
